We performed an exploratory data analysis on the heart disease dataset to gain a better understanding of it. To derive meaningful insights from the data, we created various graphs and visualizations. Additionally, we implemented different models including random forest, XGBoost, and SVM, and compared their accuracy to determine the best performing model on the given dataset. The libraries used in this analysis were Pandas, Matplotlib, Model_selection, and Sklearn.
